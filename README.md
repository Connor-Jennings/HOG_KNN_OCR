# Optical Character Recognition


This program employes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients and the K-nearest neighbors algorithm to ID digits 1-9.

The data used for training and testing is from the MNIST dataset. Which can be found at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. 

Currently working at a 45% correct digit identification rate.
